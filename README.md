# RU-PITENS-database

This study was conducted in the [AIS laboratory](http://www.aislab.org/ "AIS") (Principal Investigator: Joo-Ho Lee (lee.aislab@gmail.com) of Ritsumeikan University.

### Abstract
RU-PITENS database (Pain expression facial images using transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) from Ritsumeikan University) contains frontal images of the faces of subjects, showing images indicating pain intensity caused by the TENS device. The experiment was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Ritsumeikan University (BKC-2019-060).
